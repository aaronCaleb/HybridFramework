Java Modifiers

public class Main

public keyword is access modifier, meaning that it is used to set the access level for classes, attributes, methods and constructors.

Modifiers are grouped into the following:
(a) Access Modifiers
(b) Non-Access Modifiers

Access Modifiers for Classes

public - The class is accessible by all the other classes
default - The class is only accessible by classes in the same package. This is used when you don't specify a modifier;

Access Modifiers for attributes, methods and constructors

public - the code is accessible for all classes
private - the code is only accessible within the declared class
default - the code is only accessible in the same package
protected - the code is accessible in the same package and child classes.

Non-Access Modifiers for Classes

final - the class cannot be inherited by other classes
abstract - the class cannot ve used to create objects, to access an abstract class, it must be inherited from another class.

Non-Access Modifiers for Attributes and Methods

final - Attributes and Methods cannot be overridden
static - attributes and methods belong to the class, rather than an object
abstract - can only be used in an abstract class and can only be used on methods. the methods do not have a body, for example abstract void run();.
the body is provided by the child class 9inherited from).
transient - Attributes and Methods are skipped when serializing the object containing them.
synchronized - Methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time.
volatile - the value of an attribute is not cached thread-locally and is always read from the main memory.
